🌍 Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis
---
A comprehensive Power BI–based analytical project exploring global trends in population, GDP, literacy, migration, infant mortality, and other key development indicators.
The project integrates data from SQL and Excel sources to create insightful dashboards and a complete analytical story.

📌 Project Overview
---
This project aims to analyze global economic and demographic patterns using multi-source datasets. The analysis includes:

Population changes from 1960–2017
GDP growth and country-wise comparisons
Regional development patterns
Literacy and its link to economic performance
Migration and factors influencing emigration
Infant mortality trends
Coastal influence on economic growth
GDP vs Population relationship
All insights are visualized using Power BI dashboards, supported by data cleaning, modeling, and DAX calculations.

🎯 Objectives
---
Integrate SQL + Excel datasets in Power BI
Clean, transform, and model data for large-scale country analysis
Perform descriptive statistics and DAX-based calculations
Build interactive dashboards (10+ dashboards total)
Present key insights through a structured report and presentation

🗂️ Dataset Description
---
1️⃣ Countries World Dataset (SQL)

Includes country-level indicators:
Population, Area, Density
Coastline Ratio
Net Migration
Infant Mortality
GDP per Capita
Literacy Rate
Phones per 1000
Birthrate, Deathrate
Agriculture, Industry, Services (% of GDP)
2️⃣ Population Per Country (Excel)

Year-wise population data (1960–2017)
Country & Code indicators
Used for long-term population trend analysis
3️⃣ Metadata (Excel)

Country
Region
Income Group
Notes on data quality
4️⃣ GDP by Country (Excel)

Year-wise GDP data (1960–2016)
Used to analyze economic growth patterns
Supports time-series and country comparison visualizations

🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
---
✔ Removed null values using forward/backward fill
✔ Unpivoted wide-format population & GDP sheets
✔ Removed regional entries (kept country-level data only)
✔ Standardized units (percentages vs numeric fields)
✔ Created relationships across datasets using Country Name, Country Code
✔ Prepared model for DAX calculations & trend analysis

📊 Dashboards Created
---
1. Population Analysis Dashboard

Top populated countries (China, India)
Global population mean, median, SD
Year-wise population growth trends

2. GDP Analysis Dashboard

GDP leaders (US, China, Japan, Germany)
GDP trend from 1960–2016
Country & income group comparisons

3. Region-wise Development Dashboard

Population density
Arable land distribution
GDP per capita by region
Birthrate & deathrate comparison

4. Infant Mortality Dashboard

Highest & lowest mortality countries
Mortality vs GDP per capita (negative correlation)
Climate-wise distribution

5. Net Migration Dashboard

High-income countries showing highest positive migration
Emigration countries (Micronesia, Samoa)
GDP per capita vs Net migration (positive correlation)

6. Emigration Analysis Dashboards (1 & 2)

Factors influencing emigration
Sector contributions (Agriculture/Industry/Services)
Population density impact

7. Literacy Dashboard

Global literacy = 83.33%
Strong literacy–GDP correlation
Income group impact on literacy

8. Population vs GDP Relationship Dashboard

No strong relation between population size and GDP
GDP per capita as key economic indicator

9. Coastal Development Dashboard

Coastline vs GDP
Coastline vs Population
Coastline vs Literacy
Coastline vs Economic Sectors

🧠 Key Insights (Summary)
---
India & China dominate population size but do not lead in GDP per capita.
US leads global GDP; GDP per capita reveals real economic strength.
Wealthy countries = higher literacy + lower infant mortality.
High-income countries attract migrants; low-income countries experience emigration.
Service sector dominates economic contribution globally.
Coastal access does not guarantee high GDP or literacy.
GDP per capita continues rising globally—driven by industrialization and services, not geography.

🏁 Conclusion
---

Economic progress is influenced more by:
Education (Literacy)
Economic Structure (Service Sector)
Policy & Governance
rather than natural factors like coastline length or climate.

Human development, economic planning, and industrialization remain the strongest drivers of national prosperity.
